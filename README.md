## Welcome to gmingrealm, the best gaming website out there.
Now, due to the games files exceeding over **10GB** ansd github not support git LFS for forked repositorys (goofy ahh github) we have moved to using [**gitlab**](https://gitlab.com/superredeyeball/GmingRealm) in unison with **netlify** for deploying.
Now, [superredeyeball.github.io](https://superredeyeball.github.io/) redirects to [superredeyeball.netlify.app](https://superredeyeball.netlify.app/).

We are going to soon make it also redirect to the same directory/game you were originally trying to go to when trying to use the old domain but make it just give you a popup, but yea.
